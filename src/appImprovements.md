Approval Rating: 
All users have an approval rating that can be seen.
If somebody approves a bunch of posts when the posts are older, then it has less of an impact on their approval rating than it does with newer posts. Upvoting a bunch of posts within a strict time period will have a negative impact on your rating.

If a user approves something but the sources end up being weak, all users will gain lower approval ratings. 
But if the original poster improves their post to provide better sources, then the approval rating very slightly increases.
If people upvote something but they were not correct, then their approval rating will lower.
